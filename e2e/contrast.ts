/**
 * Composite-aware WCAG 1.4.3 contrast measurement.
 *
 * This exists because axe is not a complete contrast oracle. Two classes of
 * text never reach the `violations` array a gate asserts on:
 *
 *  - text over a surface axe declines to resolve — a gradient, an `rgba()` over
 *    an unknown backdrop, or a `color-mix()`. This palette is built out of them.
 *    Every tint in `style.css` is a translucent `rgba()` layered over whatever
 *    panel happens to be behind it: `--callout-bg`, which is the surface under
 *    the prose of THIRTEEN callouts including every "Why this matters" and both
 *    red warnings; `--warning-bg` and `--danger-bg`, the second of which also
 *    paints `.cipher-block.repeat`, the tinted row marking ECB's leaked duplicate
 *    blocks; `--accent-dim`, which is both the unlit `.bit-cell` of the avalanche
 *    grid and the hover surface of every section-nav link; and `--table-stripe`
 *    under every even row of the four-way comparison table. On top of those the
 *    hero aside is a `color-mix(in oklab, var(--accent) 6%, transparent)` and the
 *    shared top bar's `--cl-ink` is a `color-mix(in srgb, ...)`. axe files all of
 *    them under `incomplete`, so a violations-only gate measured the contrast of
 *    almost none of this lab's explanatory prose.
 *  - text faded by an ancestor's `opacity` — axe reads the declared `color`,
 *    which is not the colour that lands on screen. This page has exactly one such
 *    rule and it is not decorative: `.cl-hero-sub { opacity: .85 }` fades the
 *    subtitle directly beneath the H1. Through the composite it measures 6.29:1
 *    in dark and 4.92:1 in light — a pass, but a pass with 0.42 of margin in
 *    light, which is not a number to be taking on trust from a declared value.
 *
 * So: walk every element that owns text, composite the real painted result
 * (translucent colours, gradient stops and opacity groups included), and
 * compute the ratio against the surface the text is genuinely sitting on
 * rather than against white. A gradient is judged at its worst stop.
 *
 * Opacity is modelled the way the compositor actually does it: an element with
 * `opacity < 1` renders its subtree into a group, then composites the group
 * over the backdrop. That means the *text* and the *background beside it* fade
 * onto the same backdrop independently — which is why both are carried through
 * the walk as a pair rather than fading the foreground alone.
 *
 * The ancestor walk is geometry-aware, because DOM ancestry is not the same
 * thing as "painted underneath". An absolutely positioned child can render
 * entirely outside its parent's box, and then the parent's background is simply
 * not behind it. So an ancestor's own paint is applied only when its border box
 * actually intersects the text's box; a partial intersection still counts, so
 * the judgement stays worst-case. Opacity is unconditional either way — an
 * opacity group fades its whole subtree wherever that subtree happens to paint.
 *
 * Three things this page forced on top of that, each of which otherwise makes
 * the helper report a ratio nothing on screen has:
 *
 *  - TEXT SCROLLED OUT OF A CLIPPING ANCESTOR PAINTS NOTHING. Here the clipping
 *    boxes are the three table wrappers — `.kat-table-wrapper` around a
 *    640px-minimum table, `.comparison-table-wrapper` around a 700px-minimum
 *    one, and `.sbox-grid-wrap` around the 16x16 S-box grid, all
 *    `overflow-x: auto` — plus `.ra-progress` (`overflow: hidden`) and the
 *    `.sr-only` idiom. At 380px the first two genuinely scroll, so most of the
 *    comparison table and half the KAT table's expected-ciphertext column are
 *    outside the frame. Content scrolled past those is not dimmed or partly
 *    drawn — it is absent, and asking what colour it sits on has no answer. Its
 *    rect is still outside every ancestor's box, so the ancestor walk would find
 *    nothing behind it and fall through to white, inventing a failure. Skip it,
 *    and rely on the content that IS in view, which is measured for real.
 *
 *  - TRANSPARENT TEXT PAINTS NOTHING. Anything drawn `color: transparent` lays
 *    no ink down; compositing a zero-alpha foreground just returns the backdrop
 *    and reports a fixed 1:1. There is no contrast requirement on ink that is
 *    never laid down.
 *
 *  - SVG PAINTS IN DOCUMENT ORDER, SO SIBLINGS CAN BE THE BACKGROUND. This lab
 *    draws every figure it has — the S-box grid, the round-dot tallies, the SM4
 *    pipeline, the 128-cell avalanche grid, the decision tree — in HTML tables,
 *    flexbox and CSS grid rather than SVG, so the sibling walk finds nothing to
 *    do. Its only SVG is the shared top bar's two `aria-hidden` marks. The branch
 *    is kept because the alternative is a helper that silently mismeasures the
 *    first labelled diagram anyone adds: an ancestor-only walk would composite a
 *    `<text>` onto the `<svg>`'s own transparent background rather than onto the
 *    `<rect>` drawn under it, and report a ratio nothing on screen has.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS WALK CANNOT SEE, stated so neither is mistaken for coverage.
 *
 * FIRST, generated content. The walk iterates ELEMENTS, and a
 * `::before`/`::after` is not one — nor is it one to axe's `color-contrast`
 * rule. On this page that gap is currently empty rather than merely unexamined:
 * `style.css` and the shared header's inline block between them contain no
 * `content` declaration at all. The only pseudo-element selectors either file
 * uses are the `*, *::before, *::after` box-sizing reset and three
 * `::-webkit-scrollbar` rules, none of which draws a glyph. `nontext.ts` runs the
 * generated-content check at every driven state regardless, so the first one
 * added is measured rather than assumed.
 *
 * SECOND, a `background-image` that is not a gradient. `sampleLayer` returns
 * transparent for a `url(...)` layer, because a raster or an external SVG cannot
 * be sampled from CSS. This page has exactly one and it is load-bearing: `select`
 * sets `appearance: none`, which removes the UA's own dropdown affordance, and
 * replaces it with an inline data-URI chevron. That glyph is therefore the only
 * thing on screen saying a `<select>` is a `<select>`, it is a meaningful graphic
 * under SC 1.4.11, and neither this walk nor axe nor `nontext.ts` can see it. It
 * was measured by hand from the stroke colour in the data URI against the
 * `--bg-input` fill it is painted on: it was `#8b949e`, which is 5.39:1 in dark
 * but only 2.78:1 in light — a real failure, fixed in `style.css` by giving the
 * light theme its own chevron at `#78838f` (3.49:1). The hand measurement is
 * recorded here because nothing in this directory can regress-test it.

/**

 * Two short-lived renderings exist here and neither needs the narrowed form. The
 * `.sg-hot` / `.sg-row-hot` / `.sg-col-hot` highlights on the S-box grid live
 * 1100ms each while the animation steps — but under the reduced motion this gate
 * asserts, `animateAriaSbox()` skips the stepping entirely and applies the final
 * highlight immediately, so it is stable and a whole-page scan measures it every
 * time. The same is true of the SM4 pipeline's `.ra-stage.active`: 55ms per stage
 * when animating, permanent on `feed` under reduced motion. The one genuinely
 * transient thing left is the 900ms "Copied" flash on a copy control, and the
 * gate deliberately does not claim to scan it (see `driveAllStates`).
 *
 * The parameter is kept because the narrowed form is what makes a short-lived
 * state measurable at all: a class that lives 500ms is shorter than a full axe
 * pass, so a whole-page scan would catch it only sometimes, and a
 * sometimes-measured assertion is worse than none.

     * stricter than axe on decorative content. Honour the same boundary.
     *
     * The boundary cuts both ways and is a known gap: text that is
     * `aria-hidden` but still painted is skipped by BOTH oracles, so what this
     * lab hides was enumerated and measured by hand rather than assumed.
     *
     * This lab hides SIX things, and unlike most in this fleet, two of them
     * carry real ink and one of them carries live VALUES. That makes this
     * docblock a measurement rather than a reassurance.
     *
     * Three are genuinely empty of text and need nothing: `#av-grid`'s 128
     * `.bit-cell` spans, the `.round-dot` tallies (hidden per-dot by
     * `fillRoundDots()`, which exposes the count once on the container as
     * `role="img"` with an `aria-label`), and the three `<canvas>` elements of the
     * ECB-penguin row. The shared top bar's two `<svg>` marks are the fourth.
     *
     * The two that DO paint text were measured by hand, since neither oracle
     * will:
     *
     *  - `#aria-sbox-grid`, the 16x16 ARIA S1 table. Its 256 `.sg-cell` values are
     *    `--text-primary` on `--bg-input` (11.73:1 dark, 14.76:1 light) and its 33
     *    headers are `--text-muted` on `--bg-secondary` (5.70:1 dark, 5.08:1
     *    light). The `.sg-hot` landing cell is `--button-text` on `--accent`
     *    (8.27:1 dark, 5.42:1 light). Exposing the table itself would be 289 cells
     *    of hex to arrow through, so it is deliberately a picture: its wrapper
     *    carries `role="img"` with a describing label, and every lookup the
     *    animation performs is announced in words through `#aria-sbox-step`,
     *    which is a `role="status"` OUTSIDE the hidden subtree and is measured
     *    normally.
     *  - `#sm4-anim`, the SM4 round schematic — and this one hides live values:
     *    the four 32-bit state words and the round key, re-rendered every round.
     *    `.ra-word` is `--text-primary` on `--bg-input` (11.73:1 / 14.76:1),
     *    `.consumed` is `--accent` (6.33:1 / 4.91:1), `.rk` is `--warning`
     *    (7.59:1 / 5.91:1), `.ra-stage` is `--text-secondary` (6.41:1 / 6.81:1)
     *    and `.ra-stage.active` is `--button-text` on `--accent` (8.27:1 /
     *    5.42:1). What keeps the hiding defensible is that the value a reader
     *    needs is not only in here: `#sm4-anim-round` states "Round N of 32 — new
     *    word X_ = <hex>" in a `role="status"` outside the subtree.
     *
     * Finding these is what the hand pass is for. The S-box grid's hot row and
     * column headers — `--accent` on the `--accent-dim` tint — measured 4.25:1 in
     * the light theme, a real 1.4.3 failure that BOTH oracles skip by convention
     * and that `aria-hidden` does nothing to excuse, because 1.4.3 governs what a
     * sighted reader sees. It is fixed in `style.css` with a `--accent-on-dim`
     * token; the same token fixes `.exhibit-nav a:hover`, which had the identical
     * pair on the identical surface and was NOT hidden.

     * parent whose border box does not overlap the text paints nothing behind
     * it. Applied to the ROOT it is wrong, and wrong in the direction that

     * box (CSS Backgrounds 3, "The Canvas Background"); if the root's own
     * background is transparent the value is taken from `<body>` instead.
     *
     * The failure this prevents is not hypothetical — it cost a run elsewhere in
     * this fleet. A lab that sets `html, body { height: 100% }` has both boxes
     * exactly one viewport tall while the document runs several viewports long,
     * so every element below the fold intersects neither, the walk ends with a
     * transparent backdrop, and it falls through to WHITE. In a dark theme that
     * reports muted footer text against a white page that does not exist — 34 of
     * 38 findings in one run elsewhere in this fleet — and it can mask a real
     * failure in the other direction just as easily.
     *
     * It IS a no-op on this page today, and it is worth saying exactly why:
     * `style.css` sets `html { background-color: var(--bg-primary) }` — with a
     * standing comment next to it explaining that the declaration exists so the
     * body background is not promoted to the canvas and reported as transparent —
     * so the first branch below returns an opaque colour and the `<body>`
     * fallback is never reached. That is one declaration away from breaking, on a
     * page that runs nine sections and many screens deep, in a theme whose page
     * surface is `#0f1117`. Delete that line and every element below the first
     * screen would suddenly be measured against a white page that does not exist.
